Little Eye Utils
================

Some common capabilities that android developers can take advantage of.

Logger: A wrapper around android.util.log
- Supports changing log levels based on release
- Supports writing logfile to a separate file on disk (not just logcat)

ClarkKent: A mild-mannered reporter
- Supports remote reporting of events, errors and latencies.
- These can be reported to different services such as parse, google analytics, crashlytics, etc.
