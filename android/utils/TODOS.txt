Logger:
- Rollover of logfile
- When writing to separate logfile, format the log nicely
- Write exception stack properly in the logfile
- Allow user to upload this log file to a simple REST service
- Use varargs to prevent unnecessary string creation

ClarkKent:
- Implement Reporters: Parse, Crashlytics
- Initialize Crashlytics in a thread because of slow startup time
- Infrastructure for a Reporter to persist to disk (offline mode)
- Infrastructure for a Reporter to batch up reportables (use network efficiently)
- Think about what a subclass of a Event/Failure/Latency would look like.  How can a *Reporter understand custom fields?

When this exceeds 10 items, move this list to GitHub issues :-)
